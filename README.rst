Esper
=====
**Esper is a lightweight Entity System module for Python, with a focus on performance.**

Esper is an MIT licensed Entity System, or, Entity Component System (ECS).
The design is based on the Entity System concepts outlined by Adam Martin in his blog at
http://t-machine.org/, and others. Efforts were made to keep it as lightweight and performant
as possible.

The following Wikipedia article provides a summary of the ECS pattern:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system

API documentation is hosted at ReadTheDocs: https://esper.readthedocs.io


```
As of Esper v1.5, the behavior of the `try_component` & `try_components` methods has changed.
Please see the notes at the bottom of this README.
```

1) Compatibility
----------------
Esper is a Python 3 library only. Specifically, all currently supported versions of Python 3. 
It also supports Pypy3. Being written in pure Python, it should work on *any* compliant
interpreter. Continuous Integration (automated testing) is done for both CPython and PyPy3.


2) Installation
---------------
No installation is necessary. Esper is a Python package with no dependencies or extensions.
Simply copy the *esper* folder into your project folder, and *import esper*.

If you prefer, Esper is also available on PyPI for easy installation via pip::

    pip install esper


3) Project Structure
--------------------
* World

A World is the main point of interaction in Esper. After creating a World object, you will use
that object to create Entities and assigning Components to them. A World is also assigned all of
your Processor instances, and handles smoothly running everything with a single call per frame.
Of course, Entities, Components and Processors can be created and assigned, or deleted while
your application is running.


* Entities 

Entities are simple integer IDs (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.).
Entities are "created", but they are generally not used directly. Instead, they are
simply used as IDs in the internal Component database to track collections of Components.
Creating an Entity is done with the World.create_entity() method.


* Components

Components are defined as simple Python classes. In keeping with a pure Entity System
design philosophy, they should not contain any logic. They might have initialization
code, but no processing logic whatsoever. A simple Component can be defined as::

    class Position:
        def __init__(self, x=0.0, y=0.0):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

In addition, the excellent `dataclass` decorator is available in Python 3.7+.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#module-dataclasses
This decorator simplifies defining your Component classes. The attribute names don't need to
be repeated, and you can still instantiate the Component with positional or keyword arguments::

    from dataclasses import dataclass as component

    @component
    class Position:
        x: float = 0.0
        y: float = 0.0


* Processors

Processors, also commonly known as "Systems", are where all processing logic is defined and executed.
All Processors must inherit from the *esper.Processor* class, and have a method called *process*.
Other than that, there are no restrictions. All Processors will have access to the World instance,
which is how you query Components to operate on. A simple Processor might look like::

    class MovementProcessor(esper.Processor):

        def process(self):
            for ent, (vel, pos) in self.world.get_components(Velocity, Position):
                pos.x += vel.x
                pos.y += vel.y

In the above code, you can see the standard usage of the *World.get_components()* method. This
method allows efficient iteration over all Entities that contain the specified Component types.
This method can be used for querying two or more components at once. Note that tuple unpacking
is necessary for the return component pairs: *(vel, pos)*.  In addition the Components, you also
get a reference to the Entity ID (the *ent* object) for the current pair of Velocity/Position
Components. This entity ID can be useful in a variety of cases. For example, if your Processor
will need to delete certain Entites, you can call the *self.world.delete_entity()* method on
this Entity ID. Another common use is if you wish to add or remove a Component on this Entity
as a result of some condition being met. 


4) Basic Usage
--------------

The first step after importing Esper is to create a World instance. You can have a single World
instance for your entire game, or you can have a separate instance for each of your game scenes.
Whatever makes sense for your design. Create a World instance like this::

    world = esper.World()


Create some Processor instances, and assign them to the World. You can specify an
optional processing priority (higher numbers are processed first). All Processors are
priority "0" by default::

    movement_processor = MovementProcessor()
    collision_processor = CollisionProcessor()
    rendering_processor = RenderingProcessor()
    world.add_processor(movement_processor, priority=2)
    world.add_processor(collision_processor, priority=3)
    world.add_processor(rendering_processor)
    # or just add them in one line: 
    world.add_processor(SomeProcessor())


Create an Entity, and assign some Component instances to it::

    player = world.create_entity()
    world.add_component(player, Velocity(x=0.9, y=1.2))
    world.add_component(player, Position(x=5, y=5))

Optionally, Component instances can be assigned directly to the Entity on creation::

    player = world.create_entity(Velocity(x=0.9, y=1.2), Position(x=5, y=5))


Executing all Processors is done with a single call to world.process(). This will call the
process method on all assigned Processors, in order of their priority. This is usually called
once per frame update of your game.::

    world.process()


Note: You can pass any args you need to *world.process()*, but you must also make sure to receive
them properly in the *process()* methods of your Processors. For example, if you pass a delta time
argument as *world.process(dt)*, your Processor's *process()* methods should all receive it as:
*def process(self, dt):*
This is appropriate for libraries such as **pyglet**, which automatically pass a delta time value
into scheduled methods.  


5) Additional methods
=====================

Adding and Removing Processors
------------------------------
You have already seen examples of adding Processors in an earlier section. There is also a *remove_processor*
method available:

* World.add_processor(processor_instance)
* World.remove_processor(ProcessorClass)

Depending on the structure of your game, you may want to add or remove certain Processors when changing
scenes, etc. 

Adding and Removing Components
------------------------------
In addition to adding Components to Entities when you're creating them, it's a common pattern to add or
remove Components inside of your Processors. The following methods are available for this purpose: 

* World.add_component(entity_id, component_instance)
* World.remove_component(entity_id, ComponentClass)

As an example of this, you could have a "Blink" component with a *duration* attribute. This can be used
to make certain things blink for s specific period of time, then disappear. For example, the code below
shows a simplified case of adding this Component to an Entity when it takes damage in one processor. A 
dedicated *BlinkProcessor* handles the effect, and then removes the Component after the duration expires::

    class BlinkComponent:
        def __init__(self, duration):
            self.duration = duration


    .....


    class CollisionProcessor(esper.Processor):

        def process(self, dt):
            for ent, enemy in self.world.get_component(Enemy):
                ...
                is_damaged = self._some_method()
                if is_damaged:
                    self.world.add_component(ent, BlinkComponent(duration=1))
                ...


    class BlinkProcessor(esper.Processor):

        def process(self, dt):
            for ent, (rend, blink) in self.world.get_components(Renderable, BlinkComponent):
                if blink.duration < 0:
                    # Times up. Remove the Component:
                    rend.sprite.visible = True
                    self.world.remove_component(ent, BlinkComponent)
                else:
                    blink.duration -= dt
                    # Toggle between visible and not visible each frame:
                    rend.sprite.visible = not rend.sprite.visible


Querying Specific Components
----------------------------
If you have an Entity ID and wish to query one specific, or ALL Components that are assigned
to it, the following methods are available: 

* World.component_for_entity
* World.components_for_entity

The *component_for_entity* method is useful in a limited number of cases where you know a specific
Entity ID, and wish to get a specific Component for it. An error is raised if the Component does not
exist for the Entity ID, so it may be more useful when combined with the *has_component*
method that is explained in the next section. For example::

    if self.world.has_component(ent, SFX):
        sfx = self.world.component_for_entity(ent, SFX)
        sfx.play()

The *components_for_entity* method is a special method that returns ALL of the Components that are
assigned to a specific Entity, as a tuple. This is a heavy operation, and not something you would
want to do each frame or inside of your *Processor.process* method. It can be useful, however, if
you wanted to transfer all of a specific Entity's Components between two separate World instances
(such as when changing Scenes, or Levels). For example::
    
    player_components = old_world.components_for_entity(player_entity_id)
    ...
    player_entity_id = new_world.create_entity(player_components)

Boolean and Conditional Checks
------------------------------
In some cases you may wish to check if an Entity has a specific Component before performing
some action. The following methods are available for this task:

* World.has_component(entity, ComponentType)
* World.has_components(entity, ComponentTypeA, ComponentTypeB)
* World.try_component(entity, ComponentType)
* World.try_components(entity, ComponentTypeA, ComponentTypeB)


For example, you may want projectiles (and only projectiles) to disappear when hitting a wall in
your game. We can do this by checking if the Entity has a `Projectile` Component. We don't  want
to do anything to this Component, simply check if it's there. Consider this example::

    class CollisionProcessor(esper.Processor):

        def process(self, dt):
            for ent, body in self.world.get_component(PhysicsBody):
                ...
                colliding_with_wall = self._some_method(body):
                if colliding_with_wall and self.world.has_component(ent, Projectile):
                    self.world.delete_entity(ent)
                ...


In a different scenario, we may want to perform some action on an Entity's Component, *if* it has
one. For example, a MovementProcessor that skips over Entities that have a `Stun` Component::

    class MovementProcessor(esper.Processor):

        def process(self, dt):
            for ent, (body, vel) in self.world.get_components(PhysicsBody, Velocity):

                if self.world.has_component(ent, Stun):
				    stun = self.world.component_for_entity(ent, Stun)
				    stun.duration -= dt
					if stun.duration <= 0:
					    self.world.remove_component(ent, Stun)
				    return	# Return without processing movement

				movement_code_here()
                ...


Lets look at the core part of the code::

    if self.world.has_component(ent, Stun):
        stun = self.world.component_for_entity(ent, Stun)
        stun.duration -= dt

This code works fine, but the *try_component* method can accomplish the same thing with one
less call to `World`. The following example will get a specific Component if it exists, or
return None if it does not::

    stun = self.world.try_component(ent, Stun)
    if stun:
        stun.duration -= dt

With Python 3.8+, the new "walrus" operator (`:=`) can also be used, making the `try_component`
methods even more concise ::

    if stun :=  self.world.try_component(ent, Stun):
        stun.duration -= dt
